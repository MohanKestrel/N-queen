# N-queen
This my mini project.

The famous N queen problem using c and php

I have develope a code in c language for solving this problem and produce the result..
Then the program is compiled and made an executive file.
The the c program results is stored in PHP variable using by using exec() function in php.
Using that php variable strings i have displayed the result in webpage..

Defects in this project..
sice c is a platform dependent the c executive file is only executed on 32bit operating system.
hence this project is only work in 32 bit windows operatig sysytem.
